# Wasteless Coding Assistant

iso helps developers create efficient, secure, and less wasteful code directly within their coding environment. It aims to simplify the coding process, reduce duplication, and aid in identifying potential security issues.

## Key Features

### Code Simplification
iso analyzes your codebase to provide insights into your code's complexity. Use these insights to refactor your code into a more readable, maintainable, and efficient version. The simpler the code, the less the maintenance overhead, leading to reduced waste in terms of time and computational resources.

### Duplication Detection
Clean up your code with iso's duplication detection feature. iso identifies duplicate segments in your code, allowing you to eliminate redundancy, improve your software's efficiency, and minimize potential errors.

### Security Enhancement
With iso, catch potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process. Early identification and resolution of security issues lead to more secure software, minimizing the need for patches and fixes down the line, and reducing waste.

## Detailed Description

In a world increasingly conscious of our environmental footprint, creating sustainable software solutions is paramount. iso is designed to aid developers in this endeavor, promoting wasteless coding practices right from your editor.

iso's code simplification feature provides insights into the complexity of your code, helping you streamline it for efficiency. This results in reduced maintenance overhead and computational resource usage.

iso also targets code duplication, a common issue in large codebases. By identifying and eliminating duplicates, iso helps you create cleaner, more efficient code.

Additionally, iso helps identify potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process. This proactive approach to security leads to more robust software and reduces waste associated with patches and fixes.

Join the wasteless coding movement with iso, your go-to assistant for creating efficient and less wasteful software.

## Note

While iso initially supports Python, our goal is to extend its capabilities to support every programming language. We will continually refine iso and introduce new features based on user feedback and evolving needs.
